    General game playing involves game servers, which host matches, and game
    players, which participate in those matches. To get started, you can download
    a game server program and a configurable game player program. You can use the
    game server to host your own matches, and you can have the configurable game
    player participate in those matches.

    <h2>Configurable Game Player</h2>

    <p>Set up your own player without having to write a line of code, using
       the <a href="https://googledrive.com/host/0B7YDIhGuSOOKQjdjaXVrTVJEUVk/ConfigurablePlayer.jar">
       configurable game player.</a> Instead of writing code, you can adjust various
       settings that determine how the player chooses its moves. For example, you can
       make the player choose moves randomly, or based on statistical game simulations,
       or based on searching every possible way to play through the game.</p>
       
    <p>Once you've made your choices, the configurable gamer displays useful graphs
       as it plays, so you can get immediate feedback about your choices. For example,
       if you want to know what impact remembering explored game states will have on the
       player's memory consumption, you can play a match with that feature enabled and one
       with it disabled, and compare the graphs of memory consumption.</p>
       
    <h2>Game Server</h2>

    <p>Once you get your player running, you'll want to have it play games. Use the
       <a href="https://googledrive.com/host/0B7YDIhGuSOOKQjdjaXVrTVJEUVk/GameServer.jar">
       game server program</a> to host matches on your machine. Choose from a large library
       of games to play, select which players will participate in the match, and get started!
       You can save the match transcript on your computer, or publish it to the web so that
       everyone can watch the match live. Published matches will count toward an
       <a href="//www.ggp.org/view/cs227b/players/">online leaderboard</a> where players are
       ranked based on the matches they've played.</p>
