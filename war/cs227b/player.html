    <p>Setting up your own player can be easy with the
    <a href="https://googledrive.com/host/0B7YDIhGuSOOKQjdjaXVrTVJEUVk/ConfigurablePlayer.jar">
    configurable game player</a>. To get started, first download the player to your
    computer. Once the program is downloaded, run it. When you start the player, you'll see
    a screen like this:</p>
    
    <center><table border=1><tr><td><img src="PlayerSetup.png"></img></td></tr></table></center>
    
    <p>Click the + button at the top to create a new player. The player will be assigned a port
    and a random name automatically, and a tab will appear where you can configure the player
    and view details about its behavior. This tab will look like this:</p>
    
    <center><table border=1><tr><td><img src="ConfigPanel.png"></img></td></tr></table></center>
    
    <p>Players are assigned ports starting from 9147. Each player gets four tabs: configuration,
    match, network, and detail. <b>Configuration</b> has all of the options for configuring your
    player: major choices like which gaming algorithm to use, and minor choices like how much
    importance to assign to each heuristic in the heuristic gaming algorithm. <b>Match</b> shows
    all of the matches that the player has been involved in since it was started. <b>Network</b>
    shows all of the messages that the player has received or sent over the network. <b>Detail</b>
    shows a move-by-move view of the player's status, along with time series graphs. The graphs
    show the player's memory usage, the rate at which the player is exploring game states, and the
    player's best guess about what score it will get.</p>
    
    <center><table border=1><tr><td><img src="DetailPanel.png"></img></td></tr></table></center>
    
    <p>The most important configuration choice that affects your player is the selection of the
    gaming strategy. This determines how your player chooses moves when playing games. There are
    several options available:
    
    <ul>
      <li><b>Noop</b> - always plays "noop", even if it's not a legal move.</li>
      <li><b>Legal</b> - always plays the first legal move, in lexicographical order.</li>
      <li><b>Random</b> - always plays a random legal move.</li>
      <li><b>Puzzle</b> - attempts to completely solve the game, under the assumption that it's the only player,
        and then plays the move which results in the highest possible score.</li>
      <li><b>Minimax</b> - attempts to completely solve the game using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax">minimax</a> algorithm,
        and then plays the move which results in the highest possible score.</li>
      <li><b>Heuristic</b> - attempts to solve the game using the minimax algorithm, falling back
        to a heuristic after exploring a certain number of plys, and then plays
        the move which results in the highest score.</li>
      <li><b>Monte Carlo</b> - for each legal move, does many simulations of random play through the game
        after making that move, to determine an expected score if it makes that move,
        and then plays the move with the highest expected score.</li>
      <li><b>Monte Carlo Tree Search </b> - for each legal move, does many
        <a href="http://mcts.ai/">MCTS</a> simulations through the game
        after making that move, to determine an expected score if it makes that move,
        and then plays the move with the highest expected score.</li>
    </ul>
